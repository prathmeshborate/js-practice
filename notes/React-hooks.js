//useMemo used to memoize value and we can add dependency array to change the value of memoized value
//useCallback memoizes the function it also has dependancy array so it will create again if there's any change in value added in dependancy array
//memo:- it only re-renders when props are changes

//ContextAPI used to pass props. The Context API in React is designed to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
//useParams:- useParams is a hook in React Router that allows you to access the URL parameters of the current route.

//Lazy Loading:
// Split your application code using React.lazy and Suspense to load components only when they are needed. This reduces the initial load time.
