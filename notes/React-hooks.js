//useMemo used to memoize value and we can add dependency array to change the value of memoized value
//useCallback memoizes the function it also has dependancy area so it will create again if change in value added in dependancy array
//memo:- it only re-renders when props are changes

//ContextAPI used to pass props
//useParams:- seParams is a hook in React Router that allows you to access the URL parameters of the current route. The Context API in React is designed to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

//Lazy Loading:
// Split your application code using React.lazy and Suspense to load components only when they are needed. This reduces the initial load time.
